List from [cplusplus-beginner-projects](https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/3473/)

### Beginner

- [x] A program which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).
- [x] A program to convert currency X to currency Y and visa versa.
- [ ] A program that print out the following, user will input the top number:
```
*****
****
***
**
*

```
- [ ] A program that print out the following, user will input the bottom number:
```
*
***
*****
*******

```
- [ ] Develop a program that uses a randomly generated number to select 1 of 3(or more) functions to show the user.
- [ ] A guessing game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and a 100. If you guessed correctly, it will say you win. If your too high or too low it will also let you know.
- [ ] A program which reverses the numerals in an integer, that is 326 becomes 623.
- [ ] A program to simulate a simple calculator. It should accept two number from the user along with the required operation to be performed. Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication are the basic operations that should be implemented. Feel free to implement the other operations.
- [ ] A Write a program that allows you to input students' scores and weights. The program should then calculate a weighted average and score based on the data inputted by the user.
- [ ] A Perform 4-letter WORD UNSCRAMBLING i.e. List all possible combinations of 4-letters in a word. Ex: The word 'TEST' can be unscrambled as TEST,TETS,TSET,TSTE,TTSE,TTES,etc. 

### Intermediate

- [ ] A quiz program, which retrieve question, and answer from a file. Then allow the user to take the quiz/count point and return score.
- [ ] A program that accepts XHTML, parses and removes the tags. Then it prints out the remaining text.
- [ ] A program which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication of matrices. The dimensions of both the matrices would be specified by the user (dynamic memory allocation required). Use of structure or a class to define the matrix would be a good idea.
- [ ] A program which will perform the job of moving the file from one location to another. The source and destination path will be entered by the user. Perform the required error checking and handle the exceptions accordingly.
- [ ] A sophisticated linked list class. You should be able to insert and delete nodes anywhere in the list, and the nodes should have pointers to nodes both in front and behind them. 
- [ ] A Simple file encryption (using something simple like ROT13).
- [ ] A program that implements a database in C++. The fields are hard-coded, and the data is saved in a binary file. Although this isn't really flexibility, you aren't relying on any external libraries or functions.
- [ ] A program which will print all the pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals the number entered by the user. 

### Expert

- [ ]  Implement your own strstr.
- [ ] A program which acted like a personal planner. In which a user can input in event, note of thing to-do on certain date.
- [ ] A Tic Tac Toe program.
- [ ] A phone/address book program, with data save in binary files. The users should be able to add/delete/change the data.
- [ ] A simple payroll program, that would include pay rates, and hours work for employees.
- [ ] A few classes that model playing cards. Then use this framework to create your favorite card game. Blackjack..etc
- [ ] A few classes that model chess pieces. Then develop a real chess game.
- [ ] A binary tree which has search and sorting functions.
- [ ] Implement your own version of the Standard Template Library.
- [ ] A Quine, that is, a program that prints out its own source code.

### Graphics

- [ ] A program to draw a rectangle, ellipse, square, circle, point and line based on user input.
- [ ] A program to emulate Microsoft Paint. It should be possible to switch between different tools (circle, rectangle, eraser...) using pre-defined key strocks.
- [ ] A program to plot a simple x-y graph for a harcoded function (e.g. y=cos(x)). It should be possible to zoom in on any part of the graph. 
- [ ] A program to plot a graph of given equation of form y=f(x) and a range for x as command line arguments. (e.g. my_graph_plotter -eq="y=x*x" -xmin=-10, -xmax=10) - Expert. (PS: more to do with equation solving than graphics)
- [ ] Write the classic brick-break-out game. E.g. see DX Ball.
